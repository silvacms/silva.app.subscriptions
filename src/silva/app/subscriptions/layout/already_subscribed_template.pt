You (or someone using your email address) requested a subscription for
receiving change notifications for the page:

URL: <tal:url tal:replace="structure context/@@absolute_url" />

title: <tal:title tal:replace="context/get_title_or_id" />


However, this email is *already* subscribed for this URL:

<tal:url tal:replace="structure options/subscribed_content/@@absolute_url" />

which means you would already be notified of changes. You can still
confirm your subscription request by going to this URL (usually this
URL is clickable):

<tal:url tal:replace="structure options/confirmation_url" />


If you want to cancel your existing subscription, please follow this link:

<tal:url tal:replace="structure options/service_url" />
